<BODY>

  This page is served by my Raspberry Pi which is running my onboard network.<br>
  The 'Store' icon opens a QT webengine and points it to http://mfdstore.navico.com/login/?and then a lot of details.<br>
  Using dnsmasq I point mfdstore.navico.com to the local webserver.<br>
  What works are simple pages. SignalK works half/half with the potential to lock the screen. It will autorecover(close) after 5 min or so.<br>
  I noticed no monospace fonts are installed, so these I had to provide myself.
  To maintain the option to Exit myself, I'm using a navbar in the top and an iframe below.
